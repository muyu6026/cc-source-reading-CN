export const PR_BODY = `## 🤖 Installing Claude Code GitHub App

This PR adds a GitHub Actions workflow that enables Claude Code integration in our repository.

### What is Claude Code?

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) is an AI coding agent that can help with:
- Bug fixes and improvements  
- Documentation updates
- Implementing new features
- Code reviews and suggestions
- Writing tests
- And more!

### How it works

Once this PR is merged, we'll be able to interact with Claude by mentioning @claude in a pull request or issue comment.
Once the workflow is triggered, Claude will analyze the comment and surrounding context, and execute on the request in a GitHub action.

### Important Notes

- **This workflow won't take effect until this PR is merged**
- **@claude mentions won't work until after the merge is complete**
- The workflow runs automatically whenever Claude is mentioned in PR or issue comments
- Claude gets access to the entire PR or issue context including files, diffs, and previous comments

### Security

- Our Anthropic API key is securely stored as a GitHub Actions secret
- Only users with write access to the repository can trigger the workflow
- All Claude runs are stored in the GitHub Actions run history
- Claude's default tools are limited to reading/writing files and interacting with our repo by creating comments, branches, and commits.
- We can add more allowed tools by adding them to the workflow file like:

\`\`\`
allowed_tools: Bash(npm install),Bash(npm run build),Bash(npm run lint),Bash(npm run test)
\`\`\`

There's more information in the [Claude Code action repo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action).

After merging this PR, let's try mentioning @claude in a comment on any PR to get started!`
